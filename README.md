🌍 Population Density & Economic Insights Analysis
📊 Data Analytics | Visualization | Socio-Economic Intelligence
🔎 Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between population density and economic indicators to uncover meaningful socio-economic patterns and regional insights.

Using data analytics, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques, the study helps answer questions like:

How does population concentration affect economic growth?

Which regions show high density but low income?

Are there patterns between urbanization and GDP/employment?

How can insights support better planning and decision-making?

The goal is to transform raw demographic + economic data into actionable insights.

🚀 Objectives

Analyze population density distribution across regions

Study correlation with economic indicators (GDP, income, employment, etc.)

Identify high-growth and underdeveloped zones

Generate visual insights for policymakers and businesses

Build a data-driven decision support system
